const greetings = "Hello world!";

const firstThing = "This is my first js file and I hope I do well!";
console.log(firstThing);

console.log("Hello world");
console.log("This is my first js file here");

/* Questions 
NB: 
--- There is a problem with the question. If we have to declare, assign, and console.log then there is no parenthesis in the first statement.
--- So I had to use console.log directly.
1. Remove a parenthesis from the first statement and run the code. Does your statement print?
No
2. Is there an error? If so, what kind of error is it?
*Yes, I got this message:
*console.log "Hello world";
 *           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*SyntaxError: Unexpected string
*
